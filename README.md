## Hacker School Learning Styles
### _A very special-purpose Chrome extension_

To install, `git clone https://github.com/davidad/hs_learning_styles`, then in
Chrome, go to `[Menu] -> Tools -> Extensions`, check the `Developer Mode` box,
click the `Load unpacked extension...` button, and then select the
`hs_learning_styles` folder. Yep, it's that simple. Now, when you browse
profiles on `hackerschool.com,` you'll see a Learning Styles section of each
profile. (Some may be empty, of course; mine surely isn't, though.) You can set
up your own slider values on your Settings page, just as you would edit the
rest of your profile.
